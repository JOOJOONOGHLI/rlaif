    "chosen": "Sure! Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and some algae use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose (a type of sugar) through a series of chemical reactions. The process involves three main stages: light reactions, sugar synthesis, and storage reactions. Light reactions: In the light reactions, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, a pigment found in plants, specifically within organelles called chloroplasts. This process converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, which are then used in the Calvin cycle to produce glucose. Water is also split during the light reactions, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Chlorophyll is capable of absorbing light energy in the visible range (around 400-700 nanometers) and converting it into chemical energy. The energy is transferred to protons (positively charged particles) inside the chlorophyll molecule. The protons then split into electrons and a positively charged atom (such as oxygen) to produce a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction. The electrons are then transferred to a molecule called NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) through a series of reactions called electron transport chain. NADPH is a coenzyme that helps",
